## Introduction
Cube Wiki is a multitenant knowledge-management platform built with Filament.
The system allows administrators to manage tenants, users, applications, 
categories, and pages—all separated per tenant. Every page is written in 
Markdown and exposed through the Cube Wiki API so it can easily be used inside your own categories which is 
connected to one application.

## Features
### Multitenancy
- Each user can belong to one or multiple tenants.
- All data is fully isolated per tenant.
- Users can create new tenants or switch between existing one if you joined them.

### Admin features

## Applications, Categories and Pages
### Applications

- Applications act as the top level container for documentation
### Categories
- Create categories with an auto-generated slug.
- Each category must be linked to an application (selectable via dropdown).
### Pages
- Create pages with auto-generated slugs.
- Each page must be linked to a category
- Markdown editor for writing content.
- Markdown is stored as is and served via the API.

## Slug generation
Slug is automatically generated from the name of the application, category or page with 
Spatie Sluggable package. When you create an application, category or page the slug will stay
So if you edit the name the slug will not change. So the links to the pages will not break.

Slug is used in the API for a cleaner URL structure.

## API overview
Each tenant receives one API token, generated by admin.
This token provides access to all data belonging to that tenant.
The API returns the complete hierarchical structure:

Tenant → Applications → Categories → Pages
